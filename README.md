<h2>Inspiration</h2>
We wanted to make a game bringing attention to the problem of pollution in Canada. Pollution is a cause for concern not only in Canada but in all of the world, and while our game keeps a mostly light-hearted tone throughout, we still believed it important to bring attention to the issue of pollution through our setting and main objective.

<h2>What it does</h2>
BennyBeaver2010 is a type racing game, built in Processing, and utilizes visual assets constructed by the group members. Help Benny by typing the words displayed on the garbage, destroying them in the process and buying him time to repair/reconstruct his dam.

<h2>How we built it</h2>
We used Processing, a powerful, specialized, easy-to-read language to build our game. Visual Studio Live Share was used to synchronously write code, and GitHub was used to organize our project into one place. We also used Paint3D, GIMP, Pixel it, Piskel, and UnScreen to produce our visual assets. The sound files were obtained from websites under the creative commons license. References for all assets can be found in our GitHub repository.

<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
None of us had any experience using processing, so it was difficult for us to both learn and then apply our knowledge towards a practical application. We also had no experience with the video game development workflow, so we had to figure out the most efficient way to design our project. Lastly, our experience in developing our own assets was minimal, so we had to figure out tools to create the assets we wanted.

<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
We finished the project in time!!!

<h2>What we learned</h2>
We learned how to use the programming language Processing, how teams go about developing games, and how to develop your own assets for the purposes of a video game.

<h2>What's next for BennyBeaver2010</h2>
We would like to eventually implement an endless mode for the game.

<h2>To run</h2>
Download the Windows independent app folder from the GitHub, and run the exe file on windows 64bit machine. If your computer has firewall problems just run the executable anyways.
